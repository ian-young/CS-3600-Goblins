searching for a ffd9 for the ending of a file -> when the ending is found, it switches to true and now searches for a header

+ This should be running in N since all threads are using a single for loop

- The threads should be spawned and stored inside of an array (size 20?)
- The threads do not need to be syncronized since they output to a file
- File name increments by 1 (use variable i for file name?)
